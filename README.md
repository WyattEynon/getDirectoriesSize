List Directories by Filesize

Checking a bunch of directory sizes in powershell is annoying. So I created a python script to do just that!
Takes directory path as a filename. Shows the sizes of all directories and files within specified directory. Ordered from largest to smallest.
Without a directory path the command will just return the directory and filesizes of the directories and files in your current working directory.
Primarily for Windows users, I'm not really sure why'd you'd need this on Mac or Linux.
